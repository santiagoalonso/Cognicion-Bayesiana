This example dataset consists of 10 participants who had their temporal discount rates measures in two conditions.

So it is a repeated measures design.

Condition C (in folder 'group 1')
Condition F (in folder 'group 2')

Filenames are in the form:

`<participant initials>-<condition>-<time stamp>.txt`
