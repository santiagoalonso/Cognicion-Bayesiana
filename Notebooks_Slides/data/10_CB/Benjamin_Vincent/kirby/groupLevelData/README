DATA IN HERE IS OVERWRITTEN EVERY TIME DATA IS IMPORTED.
DO NOT PUT RAW DATA IN THIS FOLDER


When we import data from multiple participants (in data/) then the data is combined to form one large group-level dataset. This folder saves that output.
The purpose is for inspection, to ensure no mistakes have been made.
